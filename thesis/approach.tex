\section{Controlling the Digital Twin}
This will not be part of the implementation, but this needs to be considered designing this system of a general approach and automatically generatable approach to the digital twin. This is due to the fact, if the system needs to be controlled from a digital twin, the digital twin needs to be real time capable. Dependent on the system there is a hard real time capability or a soft real time capability. This also results in the
